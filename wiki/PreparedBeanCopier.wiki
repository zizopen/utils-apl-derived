= PreparedBeanCopier =

The PreparedBeanCopier allows to prepare Java Reflection based deep copy operations in so far, that any copy operation 
will internally only use two Method.invoke(...) calls to copy values of properties.

Additionally the PreparedBeanCopier allows to map different types to each other, so that e.g. a Domain class can be mapped to its DomainDTO related type.

Code example:
{{{
PreparedBeanCopier<BeanFrom, BeanTo> preparedBeanCopier   = new PreparedBeanCopier<BeanFrom, BeanTo>(
	BeanFrom.class,
	BeanTo.class,
	new Configuration().addTypeToTypeMapping( BeanFrom.class,
											  BeanTo.class )
);
BeanTo clone1 = this.preparedBeanCopier.deepCloneProperties( beanFrom );
BeanTo clone2 = this.preparedBeanCopier.deepCloneProperties( beanFrom );
...
BeanTo cloneN = this.preparedBeanCopier.deepCloneProperties( beanFrom );

}}}

== Performance (Microbenchmark) ==

The PreparedBeanCopier is time costly once when created but very fast in creating clone instances.

It is about 5-10 times slower than simple nested getter and setter calls, but can handle still about 10000000 clone operations within 10 seconds.
This makes it about 5-10 times faster than its Apache Commons counterpart, the BeanUtils.copyProperties(...).
